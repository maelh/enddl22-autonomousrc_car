### What is this repository for? ###
This repository provides an Ackermann type of RC car simulation environment using V-REP and ROS. There are software packages integrated in order to make this happen.

### What can you do with this repo? ###
You can obtain [nav_msgs/Odometry](http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html), [sensor_msgs/IMU](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Imu.html), [tf](http://wiki.ros.org/tf), [nav_msgs](http://wiki.ros.org/nav_msgs), [geometry_msgs/Twist](http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html), [sensor_msgs/Image](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html), and [sensor_msgs/LaserScan](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html) from the simulator. More precisely, the following are all ROS topic messages from V-REP.
##Topic name | message type##

```

### Which are software packages included in this repo?###
This repo integrates many existing open-source ROS packages such as

* The V-REP RC car scene model is from [https://github.com/inkyusa/ackermann_robot](https://github.com/inkyusa/ackermann_robot), and only a map, and sensors configurations are slightly modified. Other than that, the V-REP scene model is identical. Note that the github repo recently has been removed therefore I created the identical repo. I am not holding any copyrights for this.

* [https://github.com/bartville/vrep_plugin_imu](https://github.com/bartville/vrep_plugin_imu) provides to publish ROS [sensor_msgs/IMU](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Imu.html) topic message.
 
* [https://github.com/whoenig/vrep_ros_helper](https://github.com/whoenig/vrep_ros_helper) is used to provide extra simulated clock source. This software package simply publishes */clock* topic based on the current machine clock.

* [https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation) is also used for mapping, localisation, and path planning. Frankly speaking, these software packages contain much information and may be a bit complicated those who isn't familiar with the basic understandings of some related theories. However there are awesome [tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials) provided by ROS and [other resources](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/mastering-ros-robotics-programming) may help you get through the challenges.
Note that you need this package for testing. Please run following commands for compilation.
```
1. sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-teleop-twist-keyboard ros-indigo-map-server ros-indigo-amcl ros-indigo-move-base ros-indigo-robot-pose-ekf

2. (inside the "src" folder) git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation -b indigo-devel 

3. (at catkin workspace root)catkin build
```

* [https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM) is the-state-of-the-art Monocular SLAM open source software package and it is not necessary to run the simulator, but it is a good example to demonstrate the images from V-REP can be utilised for other vision-based application.

### How do I get set up? ###
* Install ROS indigo. Please follow instructions from [http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu](Link URL) if you haven't installed it.

* Install V-REP. Please download V-REP 3.3.1 from [http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html](Link URL) to your favourite folder.

* cloning this repo by typing 
```

git clone https://enddl22@bitbucket.org/enddl22/autonomousrc_car.git
```
* ROS package compilation by 
```

catkin build
```

### How can I run all packages? ###

* Running V-REP

open a terminal and run V-REP by typing 
```

./vrep.sh
```
 at your V-REP installed path.

* Open 4 terminals and run following 4 commands for each terminal.


```

~/indigo_catkin_ws/src/ackermann_robot/launch$ roslaunch ./teleop_key.launch
~/indigo_catkin_ws/src/ackermann_robot/launch$ roslaunch ./amcl.launch
~/indigo_catkin_ws/src/ackermann_robot/launch$ roslaunch ./mapping_20m.launch
~/indigo_catkin_ws/src/ackermann_robot$ rosrun rviz rviz -d ./rviz_config/amcl_rc_car.rvi
```

### How can I see rostopic and record data? ###
* If you want to see rostopic lists, then type

```

rostopic list -v
```
* If you want to see images or plot by choosing visualization and add image_view and plot

```

rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui
```

* If you want to record data from V-REP, then type 
```

rosbag record /vrep/image_raw
```
 and multiple topics recording are also possible by 
```

rosbag record -a
```
## Extracting images from a bag file ##
* create an empty folder.
* move into the empty folder, and type 
```

rosrun image_view image_saver image:=/vrep/image_raw
```

* open a new terminal and play bag file by 
```

rosbag play ./your_bag_file_name.bag
```

### Troubles and possible workarounds ###
Here are some possible troubles and their workarounds that I found. Hope this helps somehow.

**Error message:**
YourPath/indigo_catkin_ws/src/autonomousrc_car/ackermann_robot/src/simulation.cpp:8:34: fatal error: vrep_common/VrepInfo.h: No such file or directory
 #include "vrep_common/VrepInfo.h"
                                  ^
compilation terminated.
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/simulation.dir/src/simulation.cpp.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/simulation.dir/all] Error 2

**Workaround**
"catkin clean" at YourPath/indigo_catkin_ws and "catkin build" again.


**Error message:**
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [teleop_twist_keyboard/teleop_twist_keyboard.py]: or 
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [map_server/map_server]: map_server

**Workaround**
Install dependencies and please have a look "Which are software packages included in this repo" section.

**Error message:**
My robot is not moving...or nothing happening.

**Workaround**
Please try to set a goal by clicking 2D Nav Goal from rviz top toolbar and dragging on rviz viewer (you will be able to see a green arrow).
